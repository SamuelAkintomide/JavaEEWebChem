                     A chemical substance is a form of matter having constant chemical composition and characteristic properties. Some references add that chemical substance cannot be separated into its constituent elements by physical separation methods, i.e., without breaking chemical bonds.

                    <p>
                    Helium is a chemical element with symbol He and atomic number 2. It is a colourless, odourless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert monatomic gas that heads the noble gas group in the periodic table. Its boiling and melting points are the lowest among all the elements and it exists only as a gas except in extreme conditions.
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="#Lithium">Lithium</h2>
                    <p>
                    Lithium is a chemical element with symbol Li and atomic number 3. It is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal. Under standard conditions, it is the lightest metal and the lightest solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable, and is stored in mineral oil.
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="#Beryllium">Beryllium</h2>
                    <p>
                    Beryllium is a chemical element with symbol Be and atomic number 4. It is a relatively rare element in the universe, usually occurring as a product of the spallation of larger atomic nuclei that have collided with cosmic rays. It is a divalent element which occurs naturally only in combination with other elements in minerals.
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="#Boron">Boron</h2>
                    <p>
                    Boron is a chemical element with symbol B and atomic number 5. It is a nonmetallic element, which is the only element in the group 13 of the periodic table to have a partially filled electron shell. It exists in several forms, the most common of which is amorphous boron, a dark powder, unreactive to oxygen, water, acids and alkalis.
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="#Carbon">Carbon</h2>
                    <p>
                    Carbon is a chemical element with symbol C and atomic number 6. It is a nonmetallic element with the atomic weight of 12.011. Carbon is known to form almost ten million different compounds, making it the chemical basis of all known life. It is also a key component of fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas.
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="#Nitrogen">Nitrogen</h2>
                    <p>
                    Nitrogen is a chemical element with symbol N and atomic number 7. It is a diatomic molecule with the formula N2, and makes up about 78% of the Earth's atmosphere. Nitrogen is essential for life because it is a constituent of DNA and RNA, and it is also used to make fertilizers and explosives.
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="#Oxygen">Oxygen</h2>
                    <p>
                    Oxygen is a chemical element with symbol O and atomic number 8. It is a member of the chalcogen group in the periodic table, a highly reactive nonmetal, and an oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as with other compounds. By mass, oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium.
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="#Fluorine">Fluorine</h2>
                    <p>
                    Fluorine is a chemical element with symbol F and atomic number 9. It is the lightest halogen and exists as a highly toxic pale yellow diatomic gas at standard conditions. As the most electronegative element, it is extremely reactive, as it reacts with almost all other elements, except for helium and neon.
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="#Neon">Neon</h2>
                    <p>
                    Neon is a chemical element with symbol Ne and atomic number 10. It is a noble gas that is colourless, odourless, and mostly inert. Neon is used in lighting for signs and in plasma displays and is also used as a refrigerant in cryogenics.
