### Description
Developed a full-stack Java EE web application for chemical product browsing and purchasing, integrating a SQL database for secure data management. Implemented user authentication (signup/login), a dynamic search bar, and a shopping cart system using JSF, JavaBeans, and AJAX for smooth, interactive navigation. Designed and optimised CRUD operations for managing user data, chemical properties, and transactions. Overcame challenges such as efficient database querying for search functionality and ensuring secure password storage. The project strengthened my full-stack development skills, particularly in Java-based web development, SQL database integration, and UI/UX optimisation. Future improvements include adding a supplier management system for third-party sellers.
Description
#### Core Features & Technologies Used:
-	User Authentication: Implemented a secure login and signup system with SQL database integration, allowing user data storage and validation.
-	Product Catalog & Search: Users can browse a list of chemicals, view detailed product information, and search using an AJAX-powered search bar for quick filtering.
-	Shopping Cart & Checkout: Users can add chemicals to a cart, view their selected items, and proceed to checkout, with real-time stock updates in the database.
-	Database Connectivity: CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) were implemented for both user accounts and product inventory using SQL queries.
-	Dynamic Navigation & UI: The website features a structured navigation system, including a sidebar for quick access to different sections and a dynamic top navigation bar that adjusts based on user login status.
-	Validation & Security: Implemented form validation using JavaScript and JSF standard validators to ensure data integrity, such as unique usernames and secure password policies.
#### Key Learning Outcomes:
-	Gained hands-on experience in developing full-stack web applications using JavaEE.
-	Strengthened skills in SQL database management, AJAX, and JavaBeans.
-	Improved user interface design principles, focusing on usability and navigation.
-	Developed problem-solving skills while handling debugging and exception handling in Java.
This project allowed me to apply my knowledge of Java programming and web technologies to create a functional, user-friendly system with real-world applications.
