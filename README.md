### Description
Developed a full-stack Java EE web application for chemical product browsing and purchasing, integrating a SQL database for secure data management. Implemented user authentication (signup/login), a dynamic search bar, and a shopping cart system using JSF, JavaBeans, and AJAX for smooth, interactive navigation. Designed and optimised CRUD operations for managing user data, chemical properties, and transactions. Overcame challenges such as efficient database querying for search functionality and ensuring secure password storage. The project strengthened my full-stack development skills, particularly in Java-based web development, SQL database integration, and UI/UX optimisation. Future improvements include adding a supplier management system for third-party sellers.
